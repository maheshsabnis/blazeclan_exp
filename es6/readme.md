# Programming with ES 6
    - Project or Environment Configuration 
        - Node.js, https://www.nodejs.org
            - Provides 'npm' utility (Node Package Manager)
        - Install Packages for ES 6 Programming
            - Have the package.json file
                - THis file is used to define Package COnfigurations and dependencies for the current application
                - COmmand to Create package.json
                    - npm init -y
                - Important sections of package.json
                    - "dependencies":{}
                        - COntains List of Package to Execute the Application
                    - "devDependencies":{}
                        - Contains List of Packages to Develop and Test the Application
                    - "scripts":{}
                        - Contains COmmand to perform Following operations in APplication
                            - start: to run the package
                            - build: to build the package
                            - test: to test the package            
            - Install Babel Packges in Global Scope
                - npm install -g [PACKAGE-NAME]
                    - npm install -g @bable/core @babel/cli
                        - @bable/core: Packge containing Babel Transpiler Object Model
                        - @babel/cli: Package containing Command-Line Tools for Transpilation 
                    - Installing babel in global scope will provide an access to 'babel' tool
                        - babel [Source-JS-File] -o [Target-File].js    
            - Install Packages for the applicaiton to use Babel for Coding and Compilation
                - npm install --save [PACKAGE-NAME]        
                    - Add PAckage in 'dependencies' section
                    - e.g.
                        - install --save @babel/core @babel/cli @babel/preset-env
                - npm install --save-dev [PACKAGE-NAME]
                    - Add PAckage in 'devDependencies' section

    - Using Right Features for Programming
        - Basic Features
            - Scopes using the 'let' keyword
            - Template String aka String Interpolation
                - syntax
                    - `${[Expression]}`
                        - Where Expression is String
            - Iterations
                - for..of
            - Array Methods
                - for array methods use 'Arrow Operator'
                    - It's a Simplified matchanism to pass the excutable expression to the method 
                    - SYntax
                        - Array.method(([Paramatesr...])=>{[IMplementation]})
                - Iteration Methods
                 - forEach()
                    - does not return anything
                 - map()
                    - can return the output array by modifying contents of source array into new array
                 - filter()
                    - USed to filter data from source array into the Target Array based on condition
                - Search Method
                    - find(), [Only in ES 6, High-Level-JavaScript]
                - Array Manipulation Method

            - Date Methods                
        - Object Oriented Programming
        - Advanced Features
    - Delivering the Output JavaScript to the Browser
        - Transpilation of ES 6 Code to ES 3/ ES 5 Code from COmmand Line
        - Syntax
            - babel [Source-JS-File-Path] -o [Target-File-Path].js
        - add tyhe .babelrc file (Babel Resource Configuration) for defining the transpilation environment for the current application    
        - Run the Output file in Node.js server
                - node [File-Name].js
        - Refer the file using scrip0t reference in browser
