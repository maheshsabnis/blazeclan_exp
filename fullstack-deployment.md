# The Application Deployment Strategies
- Deploy Fornt-End and Back-End Separately
    - Deploy the Forn-End app on Seperate Server e.g. AWS Amplify or Use Dedicated Web App Deployment on On-Premises or Cloud
    - Back-End App Deployment
        - Database
            - RDS, DynamoDB or Dedicated EC 2 Instance
        - Application 
            - Serverless
            - AWS Back-End App
            - Microservice
- Deploy the E2E App as a Full-Stack App    
    - Create a Single Build of Both App 

# Challanges of Deployment

- Accurate Application Development (Iterative Process), the Stage 1 of the Application Development
    - User Stories creation as per the requirements
    - Test Case Creation
    - Varification of Test Cases    
    - User Stories Reviews and Acceptance
    - Coding as per the User Story
    - Write Unit Test and make sure that the code works as per the Test Case
- Accurate Application Testing  
    - Integration Tests
    - E2E Tests
    - UI Tests
    - Appropriate Bug Reporting

# Streamlining Need occured in Industry
- A Combination of Practices of S/W Development (philosophies) and Tools together to deliver the application with increase in Productivity
- The Delivery with High-Velocity and Accuracy

The Above Terminologies Were Called as 'DevOps'

- Using the Tool set for Using DevOps for FullStack Apps
    - VSCode
    - GitHub / GitLab
        - GitHub is Free
            - Integration with the Various Tools for the deployment e.g. AWS Amplify or Azure Static Apps
        - GitLab is Subscription based Paid
            - Deep Integration with AWS
    - DevOps Providers
        - AWS DevOps
        - Azure DevOps
        - GCP DevOps
    - Automation
        - Jenkins
