# Programming with React.js
- Component
    - It is an autonomous object that contains following
        - Data
            - Properties and its values aka the 'state', that will be exposed or bound to UI for generating UI dynamically
        - Functions
            - The Logic of the component
        - Events
            - They are the behavior of the HTML element.
            - They will be used to execute functions when an event is raised in DOM
            - These funcations may update Data properties (state) and will result into DOM upates
        - DOM
            - UI of the component
            - This UI will be bound with data propeties as well as functions using events
    - Two Types of Components
        - By Syntax
            - Class Components, the ES 6 class derived from the 'Component' base class. Traditionally provided by react from its first version
            - Funcational Components, the JavaScript function that retuens the HTML DOM
                - Introduced in Version 16.0 and Mandatory from Version 16.8+  
        - The Concept
            - Stateless Component
                - The component that has just HTML elements for static rendering
            - Stateful Component
                - The Component that has the Local State or data received from its parent
        - Component<P,S>
            - P, is the 'props', the data received from the Parent Component
                - the 'props' is readonly but immutable across component 
                - 'props' can pass any number and types of properties from parent to child component
            - S, is the 'state', the component's local state propety 
                - the 'state' is mutable for the component
                - when the component is unloaded from DOM, the 'state' will be killed
            - Supports the binding of data (props and state) to HTML element using following syntax
                - {this.props.[PROPERTY-NAME]} / {this.state.[PROPERTY-NAME]}
                - e.g. 'name' is property received from Parent to Child and it is to be bound to div element so show the data
                    - <div>{this.props.name}</div>
                - e.g. 'name' if the local component's state property and it is used to show data to inpue element 
                    - <input type="text" value={this.state.name}>             
            - Component's methods
                - The 'setState()', method is used to update/modify the local component's state
                    - this.setState({[PROPERTY-NAME]:[NEW-VALUE]}, callback)
                        - The state PROPERTY-NAME will be modified by NEW-VALUE received from UI
                        - callback, the function that will update the state property and commite it so that the DOM can be updated
                            - IMP ***: if the PROPRTY-NAME is singular property e.f. state, number, etc, then the callback is optional. But, if PROPRTY-NAME is of the type array or the property is updated using select element, the callback is mandetory      
                - render()
                    - The method is used to return DOM for loading and mounting UI on HTML
                - Lifecylcfle methods
                - BInd en event of HTML elements to 'functions' from component using following syntax
                    - [EVENT-NAME]={this.[FUNCTION-NAME].bind(this)}
                    - e.g. f1() is the function to be bound with button
                        - <input type="button" onClikc={this.f1.bind(this)}>
